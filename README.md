# iShelves-Bookshop-System
JAVA spring boot,JPA,MySQL, and servlet Technology .

I'm currently developing a simple Bookshop using Java Servlet Technology. Here are the functionalities I have so far:

     - Login System with database connection completed
     - User can add, list, edit and delete books (CRUD Operations)
     - User can see Books from database in a table
     - User can logout

What I want:

     - Login system with User and Admin
     - Implementation of adding an image to each book
     - Make the bookstand appear presentable with CSS (something like the image attached below)

    About Users:
      - Users can view books and detailed information about them
      - Users can select from the bookstand and place books in a shopping cart
      - Users can view information about selected books

   About Administrator:
       - Can add, update, delete (administrate) books


Both User and Admin can see available data about the books.
